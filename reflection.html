                Overall, this project is an opportunity to let me explore my interest in both graphic and web design aspects. 
                One Challenge I faced was lack of focus on the graphic design elements as I put most of the time into improving the website. 
                Moving forward, I recognise the importance of balancing attention evenly across different aspects to achieve better time management.

                 <strong>Website:</strong> 
                  Building a flexbox website has been a valuable practice providing an opportunity to enhance my technical skills. 
                  Throughout the process, I explored the knowledge of coding, designing principles and user interactivity. 
                  There were some challenges I faced during building the website. 
                  One of them was the blank spaces between sections and inflexibility when reducing the screen size. 
                  I conducted research online and sought help during the lesson time.
                  With the guidance received, I identified and debugged the issues. 
                  Instead of using ‘margin’, I found that using ‘padding’ achieved the desired outcome. 
                  Besides, rather than specifying the width and height of each image, setting “max-width”,  
                  adjusting the width to 100% and setting the “height” value to auto proved to be more flexible, 
                  allowing the image to adapt to the website’s pixel dimensions.
                  Moreover, I found building the website to be the most interesting part of this project, 
                  dedicating the majority of my time to it. 
                  I hope to have more opportunities to explore website coding or backend development in the future 
                  and further raise my interest in coding.

                  <strong>Poster:</strong>
                  The most challenging aspect of the project, for me, was designing the poster. 
                  This presented a practical challenge as this was the first time to design a poster 
                  with specific content and concepts that I was not familiar with. 
                  I struggle with generating ideas, choosing suitable colours, 
                  and determining the optimal placement of the content to give the poster a dynamic appearance, 
                  especially creating a sports poster. 
                  Applying the elements and knowledge learned in the lectures, 
                  I found that using different font size, word colours and font styles 
                  would enhance the creation of a more engaging and informative poster. 
                  These design choices helped express the necessary information 
                  and highlight the key selling point of the event. 
                  Although creating a brand new design was one of my weaker points, 
                  I would like to have more practice in the future to broaden my skills.

                    <strong>Typography:</strong>
                    Typography was an interesting aspect of this project 
                    and provided valuable practice for creating simple designs. 
                    I had to outline the features of each typography system 
                    and determine the optimal placement for the content. 
                    During the design phase, I struggled to step out of my comfort zone, 
                    as I prefer to align items to create a tidy and concise design with white space. 
                    To address this challenge, I conducted research for ideas. 
                    I found that I could complete “Axial”, ”Radial”, ”Grid” and “Bilateral” 
                    these four designs relatively quickly and with greater satisfaction. 
                    However, “Dilatational”, ”Random”, ”Modular” and”Transitional” 
                    these four designs were less satisfying 
                    as these designs needed more creativity to arrange the content effectively. 
                    In the future, I would like to practise and enhance my skills further.
