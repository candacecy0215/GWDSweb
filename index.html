            Website:
            Building a flexbox website has been a valuable practice providing an opportunity to enhance my technical skills. 
            Throughout the process, I explored the knowledge of coding, designing principles and user interactivity. 
            There were some challenges I faced during building the website. 
            One of them was the blank spaces between sections and inflexibility when reducing the screen size. 
            I conducted research online and sought help during the lesson time.
            With the guidance received, I identified and debugged the issues. 
            Instead of using ‘margin’, I found that using ‘padding’ achieved the desired outcome. 
            Besides, rather than specifying the width and height of each image, setting “max-width”,  
            adjusting the width to 100% and setting the “height” value to auto proved to be more flexible, 
            allowing the image to adapt to the website’s pixel dimensions.
            Poster:
            The most challenging aspect of the project, for me, was designing the poster. 
            This presented a practical challenge as this was the first time to design a poster with specific content and concepts that I was not familiar with. 
            I struggle with generating ideas, choosing suitable colours, 
            and determining the optimal placement of the content to give the poster a dynamic appearance, especially creating a sports poster. 
            Applying the elements and knowledge learned in the lectures, 
            I found that using different font size, word colours and font styles would help the creation of a more engaging and informative poster. 
            These design choices helped express the necessary information and highlight the key selling point of the event.
