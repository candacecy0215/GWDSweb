            <p class="caption">The inspiraton for this artwork comes from my mother's birthday party, 
              the first celebration after my family moved to the UK. 
              This artwork features an animated birthday card that includes a three-layer cake with different flavour and a candle.
              Additionally, the flame on the candle and decorations behind the cake illustrate the exciting atomsphere of the celebration.

              <p class="caption"> The inspiraton for this artwork comes from the sunset view I enjoyed with my friends in Hong Kong.
                This artwork features a dynamic rainbow appears at different times.
                During daylight hours, a sunrise version of the rainbow graces the scene,
                while a sunset version emerges when the sun goes down.
                The sun was replaced by a rainbow because, for me, the rainbow represents more hope.
