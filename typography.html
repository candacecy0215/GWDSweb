                Axial typography system is one of the most common and simple typography system used in the industry 
              that create an organized layout. 
              Text elements are aligned either left or right of the axes to make a structural design. 
              It usually has a clear hierarchy, using headings, subheadings and body text with different font size, 
              to show the content and let users navigate and understand easily.

                Radial typography system is a design revolves around a central point,radiating text elements with a circular pattern.
              This system creates a dynamic layout and the key characteristic is the central focus that usually draws users' attention.
              Text elements are placed along the circles from the central point and form a circular arrangement.
              It has a high versatility as this system commoly associated with decorative and artistic designs 
              that could be adapted to many different styles, themes or concepts.

               Dilatational typography system is a design organised along the circular path. 
                Text elements expand from a central point in a circular way. 
                Similar to the radial system, this system creates a dynamic pattern that is more artistic, 
                giving a unique visual appearance. Consistency helps group the circular arrangement together 
                through font size and colour choices for a cohesive design.

                Random typography system is a design that organises the elements randomly to create a dynamic and interesting composition. 
                Text elements between them have no specific pattern or relationship. 
                Font sizes, font weight, alignment and shapes are intentionally varied 
                with an unordered pattern to create a chaotic yet visual aesthetic design.

                Grid typography system is a structured and organised design with a grid framework. 
                This system provides a systematic and clear structure for placing and aligning text elements 
                and maintaining consistency across the design. 
                Text elements are aligned both vertically and horizontally to the grid lines to let the readers navigate and understand the information easily. 
                Many designs are based on a columnar layout to help structure the text.

                Modular typography system is a design that uses a set of modules 
                to organise and structure typographic elements to create visually cohesive design. 
                This system is based on modular units and building blocks using geometric shapes for organising text 
                and other design elements that are often incorporated with a grid system. 
                The spacing between modular units is crucial for maintaining visual balance and preventing overcrowding.

                Transitional typography system is a design that employs content to create a flowing effect. 
                Text elements transition between different levels of hierarchy to effectively guide readers through the content. 
                This involves changing font weight and size and creating visual interest to readers.

                Bilateral typography system is a symmetrical structural design. 
                Text elements are aligned at the centre of the axis to create a neat and concise design. 
                Similar to the axial system, 
                it has a clear hierarchy to show the content by changing the font weight and size. 
                The use of axial alignment contributes to a balanced composition and therefore, 
                the visual weight of text elements is evenly distributed, creating an aesthetical layout.
